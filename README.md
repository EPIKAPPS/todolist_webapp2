# todolist_webapp2

A TODO list is an application that allows you to organize and manage your pending tasks. 

Users can add tasks, mark them as completed, delete them, and view a list of completed tasks. 

Additionally, it uses localStorage to store task data, allowing users to upload and save their tasks even after closing the browser.
